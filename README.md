# Backpack Opener
A mod to help using handheld GUI items, like backpacks and terminals.  
Open them by simply right-clicking it in your inventory GUI.  
It automatically swaps the item to your active hand and open it. After closing the GUI of item, the item is swapped back and you're back in your inventory.  

Entries are managed by crafttweaker.

It's suggested to only write entries in a script with `#sideonly client` Preprocessor. Otherwise it will cause errors on dedicated server, because this mod is client only.
